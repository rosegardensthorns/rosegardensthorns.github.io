<p>You have been unjustly accused of stealing from a Lunar supply ship and have been thrown into Artemisia's prison. Your trial will be in 3 days but you have an escape plan. You will go through a series of different rooms in order to escape, including out the prisons, down the hallway, sneaking past guards into the Levana, the evil queen's, chambers, entrance rooms situated all across the castle and heavily armed and guarded watchtowers, where you may or may not receive some help from a Princess along the way. You will earn points as you continue on and gain possessions, but the question is - Will you be able to escape Artemisia or perish on Luna?</p>
