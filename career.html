													Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee when she was 14 years old, having signed an artist development deal with RCA Records. Swift proceeded to work with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally and The Warren Brothers. She eventually formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose. Swift saw Rose performing at an RCA songwriter event and suggested that they write together. They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school. Rose said that the sessions were "some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks." Swift also began recording demos with producer Nathan Chapman.
												</p>
												<p>
													After performing at a BMI Songwriter's Circle showcase at The Bitter End, New York, Swift became the youngest songwriter ever signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house. Swift left RCA Records when she was 14—she was afraid that the company would want her to record the work of other songwriters and wait until she was 18 to release an album, but she felt ready to launch her career with her own material. Swift later recalled: "I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through." She also parted ways with manager Dan Dymtrow, who later took legal action against Swift and her parents. In 2010, a judge nullified six of Dymtrow's legal claims. The remaining unjust enrichment claim was settled out of court.
												</p>
												<p>
												At an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form his own independent record label, Big Machine Records. She became one of the label's first signings, with her father purchasing a three per cent stake in the fledgling company at an estimated cost of $120,000. She was introduced to the country music business as an artist escort at the CMA Music Festival.
												</p>
												<p>
												Swift began working on her eponymous debut album shortly after signing her record deal. After experimenting with veteran Nashville producers, Swift persuaded Big Machine to hire her demo producer Nathan Chapman. It was his first time recording a studio album but Swift felt they had the right "chemistry". Swift wrote three of the album's songs alone, including two singles, and co-wrote the remaining eight with writers Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher and Angelo Petraglia. Musically, the album has been described as "a mix of trad-country instruments and spry rock guitars".
												</p>
												<p>
												Taylor Swift was released on October 24, 2006. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times described it as "a small masterpiece of pop-minded country, both wide-eyed and cynical, held together by Ms. Swift's firm, pleading voice". Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker described the 16-year-old Swift as a "prodigy". He noted that "Our Song" "stop[ped] me in my tracks" and praised the lyrics: "He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel, the other on my heart." Rolling Stone's reviewer described Swift as "bright-eyed but remarkably seasoned", and admired "Our Song"'s "insanely hooky sing-song melody that's as Britney as it is Patsy".
												</p>
												<p>
												Big Machine Records was still in its infancy upon the release of the lead single "Tim McGraw" in June 2006, and Swift and her mother helped "stuff the CD singles into envelopes to send to radio". She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift in a radio tour and later commented, "Radio tours for most artists last six weeks. Mine lasted six months." She made many television appearances, including on the Grand Ole Opry, Good Morning America, and TRL. Swift, a self-described "kid of the internet", used Myspace to build a fanbase. This was, at the time, "revolutionary in country music". Borchetta has said that his decision to sign a 16-year-old singer-songwriter initially raised eyebrows among his record industry peers but Swift tapped into a previously unknown market: teenage girls who listen to country music.
												</p>
												<p>
												Following "Tim McGraw", four further singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Our Song", "Picture to Burn" and "Should've Said No". All were highly successful on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, with "Our Song" and "Should've Said No" both reaching number one. "Our Song" made Swift the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a number-one country song. "Teardrops on My Guitar" became a minor pop hit; it reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album sold 39,000 copies during its first week of release and, as of March 2011, had sold over 5.5 million copies worldwide. Swift also released a holiday album, Sounds of the Season: The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection, in October 2007, and an EP, Beautiful Eyes, in July 2008.

												<h3>Fearless</h3>
												<span class="image featured"><img src="http://groundctrl.s3.amazonaws.com/clients/taylorswift/media/00/02/large.644ng1iaz1dp.jpg" alt="" /></span>
												<p>
												Swift's second studio album, Fearless, was released on November 11, 2008. Swift wrote seven of the album's songs alone, and co-wrote the remaining six with songwriters Rose, John Rich, Colbie Caillat and Hillary Lindsey. She co-produced the album with Nathan Chapman. Musically, it has been said that the record is characterized by "loud, lean guitars and rousing choruses", with the occasional "bit of fiddle and banjo tucked into the mix".
												</p>
												<p>
Caramanica of The New York Times described Swift as "one of pop's finest songwriters, country's foremost pragmatist and more in touch with her inner life than most adults". Josh Love of The Village Voice felt she displayed "preternatural wisdom and inclusiveness", "masterfully avoiding the typical diarist's pitfalls of trite banality and pseudo-profound". Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone described her as "a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture" whose "squirmingly intimate and true" songs seemed to be "literally ripped from a suburban girl's diary". Music critic Robert Christgau characterized Swift as "an uncommonly-to-impossibly strong and gifted teenage girl".
</p>
<p>
Swift, who now owned her own management company led by Robert Allen, promoted Fearless heavily upon its release. An episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show was dedicated to the album launch and Swift appeared on many other talk shows. She communicated with fans using social media platforms such as Twitter and personal video blogs and co-hosted the pre-show for the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards.
</p>
<p>
The lead single from the album, "Love Story", was released in September 2008 and became the second-best-selling country single of all time, peaking at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Four more singles were released throughout 2008 and 2009: "White Horse", "You Belong with Me", "Fifteen" and "Fearless". "You Belong with Me" was the album's highest-charting single, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 Album Chart with sales of 592,304, and has since sold over 8.6 million copies worldwide. It was the top-selling album of 2009 and brought Swift much crossover success.

											<h3>Speak Now</h3>
											<span class="image featured"><img src="http://taylorswiftnow.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Speak-Now-Album-Cover.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											<p>
											Swift released her third studio album, Speak Now, on October 25, 2010. She wrote all 14 songs alone and co-produced the record with longtime collaborator Chapman. Musically, it has been said that the album "expands beyond country-pop to border both alternative rock and dirty bubblegum pop".
											</p>
											<p>
Caramanica of The New York Times described the album as "savage", "musically diverse" and "excellent too, possibly her best". Theon Weber of The Village Voice remarked that the album demanded "a true appreciation of Swift's talent, which is not confessional, but dramatic: Like a procession of country songwriters before her, she creates characters and situations—some from life—and finds potent ways to describe them." Christgau found the album's songs "overlong and overworked" but remarked that "they evince an effort that bears a remarkable resemblance to care—that is, to caring in the best, broadest, and most emotional sense". Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone described Swift's songs as some of the smartest in "pop, rock or country": "Swift might be a clever Nashville pro who knows all the hitmaking tricks, but she's also a high-strung, hyper-romantic gal with a melodramatic streak the size of the Atchafalaya Swamp."
</p>
<p>
Swift carried out an extensive promotional campaign prior to Speak Now's release. She appeared on various talk shows and morning shows, and gave free mini-concerts in unusual locations, including an open-decker bus on Hollywood Boulevard and a departure lounge at John F. Kennedy International Airport. She took part in a "guitar pull" alongside Kris Kristofferson, Emmylou Harris, Vince Gill and Lionel Richie at LA's Club Nokia. The musicians shared the stage and took turns introducing and playing acoustic versions of their songs to raise money for the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum.
</p>
<p>
The album's lead single, "Mine", was released in August 2010, and five further singles were released throughout 2010 and 2011: "Back to December", "Mean", "The Story of Us", "Sparks Fly" and "Ours". Speak Now was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart. Its opening sales of 1,047,000 copies made it the 16th album in U.S. history to sell one million copies in a single week. As of September 2011, Speak Now had sold over 5 million copies worldwide.

											<h3>Red</h3>
											<span class="image featured"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HgOWanHGKBk/UIp5QYAsfWI/AAAAAAAAGes/EcRg3NTl0Ss/s1600/Taylor-Swift-Red-Review.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											<p>
											Swift's fourth studio album, Red, was released on October 22, 2012.[178] She wrote nine of the album's 16 songs alone, while the remaining seven were co-written with Rose, Max Martin, Dan Wilson, Ed Sheeran, and Gary Lightbody. Chapman served as the album's lead producer but Jeff Bhasker, Butch Walker, Jacknife Lee, Dann Huff and Shellback also produced individual tracks. Chapman said he encouraged Swift "to branch out and to test herself in other situations".[179] Musically, while there is experimentation with heartland rock, dubstep and dance-pop, it is "sprinkled among more recognisably Swiftian fare".
											</p>
											<p>
											Caramanica of The New York Times found Red "less detailed and more rushed than her usual fare" but placed it at number two on his end-of-year list, characterizing it as the album on which Swift "stops pretending she's anything but a pop megastar, one with grown-up concerns, like how two bodies speak to each other and how taste in records can be a stand-in for moral turpitude". Lisa Verrico of The Times praised her "sublime" lyrics, particularly those on the "brooding" "All Too Well". Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone enjoyed "watching Swift find her pony-footing on Great Songwriter Mountain. She often succeeds in joining the Joni/Carole King tradition of stark-relief emotional mapping ... Her self-discovery project is one of the best stories in pop."
											</p>
											<p>
As part of the Red promotional campaign, representatives from 72 worldwide radio stations were flown to Nashville during release week for individual interviews with Swift. She also appeared on many television talk shows and performed at award ceremonies in the U.S., the UK, Germany, France, Spain and Australia.
</p>
<p>
The album's lead single, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", became Swift's first number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. Six further singles were released: "Begin Again", "I Knew You Were Trouble", "22", "Everything Has Changed", "The Last Time" and "Red". "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" and "I Knew You Were Trouble" were both commercially successful worldwide. Red debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 1.21 million copies—this marked the highest opening sales in a decade and made Swift the first female to have two million-selling album openings. As of May 2013, Red had sold over 6 million copies worldwide.

											<h3>1989</h3>
											<span class="image featured"><img src="http://groundctrl.s3.amazonaws.com/clients/taylorswift/media/04/03/images/assets/large.-jSVRW6lmhcpjIU0kUppuzE6smfEaQGQJPRFdd2xux0.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											<p>
											Swift's fifth studio album, 1989, was released on October 27, 2014. Swift wrote one song alone, and co-wrote the remaining 12 with Antonoff, Martin, Shellback, Imogen Heap, Ryan Tedder and Ali Payami. Martin and Swift served as executive co-producers while Chapman, Antonoff, Heap, Tedder, Payami and Greg Kurstin produced individual tracks. Musically, it has been described as an album "driven by synths and drums in lieu of guitar". Swift herself described 1989 as her first "official" pop release.
											</p>
											<p>
The critical response to 1989 was frequently positive. Sheffield of Rolling Stone noted: "Deeply weird, feverishly emotional, wildly enthusiastic, 1989 sounds exactly like Taylor Swift, even when it sounds like nothing she's ever tried before." Molly Lambert of Grantland remarked that the "late-'80s album 1989 really resembles is Bruce Springsteen's Tunnel of Love", citing both artists' change of musical direction, shift in public image and split with longtime band members. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian praised the album's "Springsteenesque narratives of escape and the kind of doomed romantic fatalism in which 60s girl groups dealt ... On 1989 the reasons she's afforded the kind of respect denied to her peers are abundantly obvious."
</p>
<p>
As part of the 1989 promotional campaign, Swift invited fans to secret album-listening sessions, called the "1989 Secret Sessions", at her houses in New York, Nashville, Los Angeles and Rhode Island. Her "expert" use of various social media platforms was remarked upon by industry analysts. She also appeared on many talk shows, performed at award shows in the U.S. and England, and appeared as a contestant advisor for The Voice.
</p>
<p>
The album's lead single, "Shake It Off", was released in August 2014 and reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Four further singles have been released; "Blank Space" and "Bad Blood" (featuring Kendrick Lamar) both reached number one in the United States. "Style" and "Wildest Dreams" both peaked in the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100. 1989 sold 1,287,000 copies in the U.S. during the first week of release, selling more copies in its opening week than any album in the previous 12 years. This has made Swift the first and only act to have three albums sell more than one million copies in the opening release week. It later became the best-selling album of 2014, selling 3.66 million copies. As of February 2015, 1989 had sold over 8.6 million copies worldwide.
</p>
<p>
Prior to 1989's release, Swift wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, emphasizing the ongoing importance of albums, and, in November 2014, she removed her entire catalog from Spotify, arguing that the streaming company's ad-supported free service undermined the premium service, which provides higher royalties for songwriters. In June 2015, Swift criticized Apple Music in an open letter for not offering royalties to artists during the streaming service's free three-month trial period and stated that she would pull 1989 from the catalog. A day later, Apple announced that they would pay artists during the free trial period and Swift agreed to stream 1989 on the streaming service. Swift’s intellectual property rights management and holding company, TAS Rights Management, LLC, in 2014-15 filed 73 trademark applications for 20 different marks including marks pertaining to: The 1989 World Tour, Players Gonna Play, Shake It Off, and I'll Write Your Name for a wide range of goods and services. The applications were filed based upon an intent to use the marks with the various goods and services, and appear to be an effort to protect several different Taylor Swift projects.
</p>
<p>
As part of The 1989 World Tour, running from May to December 2015, Swift performed in Japan, the U.S., Canada, the UK, the Republic of Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands and Australia. HAIM, Vance Joy, Shawn Mendes and James Bay appeared as the support acts for various legs of the tour.
